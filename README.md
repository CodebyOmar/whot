## Why

I am starting this project because I know it will be challenging (I look forward to it), and because I hope someone else builds a beautiful UI/UX around it (cos I can't), so I play this game with my friends and family from my phone and laptop, and experience the same amount of fun I did as a child, no matter where we are.

## How

I'll be using JS, and I still haven't thought about how I'll be building it. I'll update this as soon as I do.

## Who

It'll be me, unless you can convince me you should be on the team.

## When

ASAP!
