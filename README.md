# Whot! (IN DEVELOPMENT)

Whot! is the national card game of Nigeria. It is played by young and old, and has come to be associated with fond memories, by me and a lot of people I know. [Read More](https://www.pagat.com/com/whot.html)

This is a JS Library that will facilitate the Nigerian Whot! Game Play.

## Why

I am starting this project because I know it will be challenging (I look forward to it), and because I hope someone else builds a beautiful UI/UX around it (cos I can't), so I can play this game with my friends and family from my phone and laptop, and experience the same amount of fun I did playing it as a child.

## How

I'll be using JS, and I still haven't thought about how I'll be building it. I'll update this as soon as I do.

### Testing

- See [test suite](./tests)

- Run `npm test`

## Who

It'll be me, unless you can convince me you are interested

## When

ASAP!
